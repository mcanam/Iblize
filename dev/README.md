## Development

i assume that you are using the latest version of browser (i recommend using chrome) and have nodejs installed on your computer. in the root directory, run the command below to install all the packages needed during development

``` bash
npm install
```

then run this command.
it will automatically open your browser

``` bash
npm run start-dev
```

now you can modify the javascript files in the `src/` folder without needing to re-bundle.

> you can see the list of commands in the package.json file
